# react-fridgescavenger-project
Attempting to create a recipe(and more) website with React, NextJS, PostgreSQL, and Express.
Ideally, a backend server will create and save user information and allow the saving of recipes and a comment section for each recipe post.

Getting a database connected to NextJS has become more trouble than it's worth. The error messages I'm getting aren't remotely descriptive. Will likely do that portion in NodeJS exclusively while implementing TDD.
